## 🧭 Guiding Principles

1. **Braille is primary**
   - Do not introduce letter-based logic into gameplay
   - Braille dots, not letters, determine correctness

2. **Accessibility is non-negotiable**
   - No color-only feedback
   - No mouse-only interactions
   - Screen reader compatibility must be preserved

3. **Simplicity over cleverness**
   - Prefer readable, explicit logic
   - Avoid abstractions that obscure dot-level behavior
